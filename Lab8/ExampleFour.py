'''This is the program that accompanies the problem outlined at the
end of this week's slides.'''

'''What do we need? Well, since employees contain a lot of information,
we will probably need an Employee class of some sort, with some helper
functions.'''

class Employee:
    '''Employee class that contains relevant information for an employee.'''
    def __init__(self, name, emp_number, position, department, salary):
        pass

    def promotion(self, new_position):
        pass

'''Helper functions'''

def employee_lookup(employee_list, employee_search):
    '''Will look up an employee and return their information'''
    pass

def add_employee(employee_list):
    '''Will prompt the user for information, create an employee and then add 
    said employee to the employee list.'''
    pass

def delete_employee(employee_list, employee_name):
    '''Deletes the specified employee from the list.'''
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
