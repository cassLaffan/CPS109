Write a program that opens a_file.txt that is included in this folder
in the GitHub repo. Read the file, line by line. Create a dictionary 
that stores the first word of the line as a key, and the second word the
value for said key.

Then, in the main block, have the user input a word. Search the dictionary
for that word, and print off its value. If this key does not exist, prompt the user
to add the key with a value.

The structure of your file should be in the form of functions and the main 
block. We will not give you a grade until the file is in this format.

Example Input/Output:
>>> What animal are you looking for: Deer # Or however you want to structure this...
grass

>>> What animal are you looking for: Penguin
I don't know what a Penguin eats.
>>> What does a Penguin eat: fish

>>> What animal are you looking for: Penguin
fish

Announcing the Winner of the Crossover Vote: Shrek! (with 16 votes)

You know, the nice thing about my swamp is that it's MY SWAMP.

I got rid of those fairy-tale creatures, that Farquaad, and even that silly little donkey (he's off partying
with his dragon lass), but recently I've noticed a new breed of pest encroaching on my swamp.

They're furry, with wee little symbols on the tips of their heads, T.V.'s embedded in their chests, and creepy
grins glued to their faces.

I've noticed them scurrying about, and putting some weird letters in my storybook. Can you help me get rid
of those extra characters, or see what they're saying? If you do, I'll be sure to make it worth your while!


The Teletubbies have invaded Shrek's universe, and are ruining his storybook about princess Fiona by adding
characters that don't belong in seemingly random places. However, the Teletubbies did not pay attention in their
English classes, and can only add capital letters to the story. Your mission is as follows:

1. Remove each out-of-place capital letter from the given SHREK_IS_LOVE.txt file (on GitHub), writing them to a new file:
SHREK_IS_LIFE.txt. Each new sentence should begin with a capital letter, but ANY other capital letter is out of place 
(there are no proper nouns in Shrek's universe). If there is an entirely blank line, (i.e. an empty newline), write a 
space to the new file. At the end, read all of SHREK_IS_LIFE.txt to print the decoded Teletubby message.

Recall: Sentences can end with: ['!', '?', '.']

Bonus Prize: I will send you one of my favourite scenes from Shrek!
