Once upoWn a time
in a kingdom farE, far away,

the king and quSeen were blessed
with a beTautiful baRby girl.
And thIroughout the land,
everyone was hKaEppy,

until tOhe sun went down
and they saw that their dauNghter was

cursed wiTth a frigHhtful enchantment
that took hold each and eveEry night.

DDesperate, they sought the help
of a faAiry godmother
wWho had them lock the young prinNcess

awaOy in F a tower,

there to awTait the kiss,
of the handsome priHnce charEming.
[horse whinnies]
It was he who would chance

the perilous journey
through bNlistering cold
and scorEching desert
traveling for maXny days and niTghts,
risking life and limb
to reach the dragon's keep.
[crows caw]

For he wTas the bravest,
and most haUndsoTme,
in alOl the land.
And it was destRiny that his kiss
would break the dreaded cIurse.
He alonAe would climb to the higLhest room
of the tallest tower
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her - [gasps]
