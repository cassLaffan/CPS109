'''
Define a function that takes a list of numbers and
returns the sum of every other element. For example:

your_function([1, 2]) = 1
your_function([1, 2, 3]) = 4
self.assertEqual(your_function([1, 5, 2, 7, 20]), 23)

Then, in a seperate file, write a set of tests for it
and make sure they all pass. Ensure everything is formatted
correctly.
