'''
Write a FUNCTION that takes an ordered list of LISTS and a new list as arguments.
The lists within this list contain integers.

This list of LISTS is ordered from shortest list to longest. If two lists are of
the same length, they're ordered from lowest starting number to highest.

This FUNCTION should use binary search to find where it needs to
insert the new list.

The main program should loop and keep adding lists using this function
until the user wants to exit.

Example (assume our initial list is [[], [4, 10], [1, 4, 6, 9], [-10, 4, 7, 100, 101]]):

>>>What list would you like to insert into the list?
>>> 1,5,6
[[], [10, 4], [1, 5, 6], [1, 4, 6, 9], [-10, 4, 7, 100, 101]]
>>>What list would you like to insert into the list?
>>>1,2
[[], [1, 2], [4, 10], [1, 5, 6], [1, 4, 6, 9], [-10, 4, 7, 100, 101]]
>>>What list would you like to insert into the list?
>>>Bye
Goodbye!


*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

The rhythmical stomping of their padded feet reverberates through the castle's walls.
Peering through the crenellations, you see the great mass of creatures halt before the gate.
Each teletubby's television stomach broadcasts grotesque promises of what they'll do if they get in.
They want revenge for the imprisonment of their leaders.
You must stop them.
You are the last hope.

For the above program, if at any time the user tries to add a teletubby to the list, you must print the sacred words:
"abscede ab hoc mundo [teletubby]" (replacing [teletubby] with the name of the specific sub-species of teletubby)

You must then proceed with your list insertion procedure as if nothing has happened, lest your troops sense your fear.
When you finally must flee, if you have exorcised at least 1 teletubby, inspire your troops to fight valiantly with a noble parting message.

Recall: The teletubbies are: ["Tinky Winky", "Dipsy", "Laa-Laa", "Po"]

Example (assume our initial list is [[], [10, 4], [1, 4, 6, 9], [-10, 4, 7, 100, 101]])
>>> What list would you like to insert into the list?
>>> 1, 2
[[], [1, 2], [10, 4], [1, 5, 6], [1, 4, 6, 9], [-10, 4, 7, 100, 101]]
>>> What list would you like to insert into the list?
>>> Po
abscede ab hoc mundo Po
>>> What list would you like to insert into the list?
>>> Bye
Do not go gentle into that good night...
